- read file and handle errors
- read from std::in

- implement md5
	- processes a variable-length message into a fixed-lenght output of 128 bits
	- process; 
		1. break up message into chunks of 512bit blocks.
		2. add padding so that it is divisible by 512.
			- bit of 1, followed by 0's. 
			- last 64 bits filled with lenght of original message modulo 2ˆ64
		3. each  512bit block modifies a 128bit state divided into 4 parts
			A, B, C, and D. 
			- A, B, C, D are initilized at
				- A = 0x67452301
				- B = 0xefcdab89
				- C = 0x98badcfe
				- D = 0x10325476


- implement sha256



Allowed functions:
◦ open
◦ close
◦ read
◦ write
◦ malloc
◦ free
Must justify:
◦ strerror
◦ exit


-> just have a folder with helper functions

- list of commands, store in list
- call on function pointer in list

- evaluate arguments:
- none: display usage
- first arg: command
	- md5
	- sha256
	- else : ft_ssl: Error: 'foobar' is an invalid command.
- options:
	- -s: interprets next arg as string to hash
		- print in following format: 
		- MD5 ("stringname") = 098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6
		- else print:
			md5: option requires an argument -- s
			usage: md5 [-pqrtx] [-s string] [files ...]
		- can be called on mulitple times
	- -q: quiet mode. Prints only the resulting hash (checksum)
		- MD5 (file) = 53d53ea94217b259c11a5a2d104ec58a
		-> 53d53ea94217b259c11a5a2d104ec58a
		- overrides -r options
	- -p: print input string before hash
	- -r: reverse output
		- any output is reversed as follows:
			- MD5 ("test") = 098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6
			-> 098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6 "test"
			- MD5 (file) = 53d53ea94217b259c11a5a2d104ec58a
			-> 53d53ea94217b259c11a5a2d104ec58a file
		- Must come before any file is read. Or else:
			- md5: -r: No such file or directory
	- file name:
		- output: MD5 (filename) = 53d53ea94217b259c11a5a2d104ec58a
	- All options (and string for -s) must come before filenames, else will be
		interpreted as a filename.
		= once an arg is interpreted as a file, all following args are
			interpreted as files
